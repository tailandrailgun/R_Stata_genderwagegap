# R_Stata_genderwagegap
Gender Wage Gap in Canada (Labour Force Survey data)

While we have tried to utilize the 'oaxaca' package available, you will see NA values returned for important statistics generated by the procedure. The reason behind this is that, as LFS Canada is based of survey data, this is not compatible with the 'oaxaca' R package as it does not allow us to input data weights anywhere. Therefore, please refer to the `STATA` procedures and output included in this submission for the decomposition approach conducted.  

All data cleaning, data manipulation and statistical procedures we have performed in both data tools -- STATA & R are identical. The main difference between two series of work in this Appendix section is the following:

`R`: Overlapping Density Plots based on Gender, Average Wage Differences by Wages, Standard Deviation of Log Wages, OLS Regression 

`STATA`: Blinderâ€“Oaxaca decomposition
